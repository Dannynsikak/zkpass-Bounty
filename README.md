## zkPass-Enabled Frontend Verification

This project demonstrates a secure and privacy-preserving user verification system on the frontend, leveraging zkPass and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkProofs). The integration ensures user data confidentiality while providing strong proof of identity and authentication.

Features
zkPass Integration: Facilitates secure data verification without exposing sensitive user information.
Zero-Knowledge Proof (zkProof): Verifies user claims (e.g., age, identity, or attributes) with cryptographic assurance, ensuring privacy.
Frontend-Centric Validation: All proof verification happens seamlessly on the client side, optimizing user experience.
Secure Communication: Utilizes cryptographic primitives to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of interactions.
Technologies Used
React/TypeScript: Frontend framework and language for modular and type-safe development.
zkPass: Privacy-preserving authentication tool for user verification.
zkProof: Cryptographic proofs ensuring secure validation of claims.

## How It Works

User Submission:

Users submit data (e.g., attributes or credentials) through a secure frontend interface.
The data is encapsulated into a zkProof using zkPass.
Proof Generation:

zkPass generates cryptographic proofs for submitted data using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Garbled Circuits.
The proofs are designed to protect user data, revealing only the necessary details required for verification.
Proof Verification:

The generated zkProof is verified on the frontend using the zkPass verification API.
The verification ensures the authenticity of the user data without exposing the actual data.
Result Handling:

Based on the proof verification result, appropriate actions are taken (e.g., granting access, confirming identity).
Example Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a sample integration of zkPass for proof verification:

`typescript

import { DvrModuleClient, extractPayload } from "@zkpass/dvr-client-ts";

// Extract payload from token
const dvrPayload = extractPayload(dvrToken);

// Instantiate the zkPass client
const dvrModuleClient = new DvrModuleClient({
baseUrl: ZKPASS_SERVICE_URL,
apiKey: API_KEY,
secretApiKey: API_SECRET,
});

// Set expected metadata for verification
const expectedMetadata = {
dvr: JSON.stringify(dvrPayload),
ttl: EXPECTED_DVR_TTL,
user_data_verifying_keys: userDataVerifyingKeys,
};

// Call the verification function
const proofOutput = dvrModuleClient.callDvrVerifyZkPassProof(
ZKPASS_ZKVM,
zkPassProofToken,
expectedMetadata
);

// Handle verification result
console.log("Verification Result:", proofOutput);`

Installation
