## zkPass-Enabled Frontend Verification

This project demonstrates a secure and privacy-preserving user verification system on the frontend, leveraging zkPass and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkProofs). The integration ensures user data confidentiality while providing strong proof of identity and authentication.

### Features

- **zkPass Integration**: Facilitates secure data verification without exposing sensitive user information.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof (zkProof)**: Verifies user claims (e.g., age, identity, or attributes) with cryptographic assurance, ensuring privacy.
- **Frontend-Centric Validation**: All proof verification happens seamlessly on the client side, optimizing user experience.
- **Secure Communication**: Utilizes cryptographic primitives to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of interactions.

### Technologies Used

- **React/TypeScript**: Frontend framework and language for modular and type-safe development.
- **zkPass**: Privacy-preserving authentication tool for user verification.
- **zkProof**: Cryptographic proofs ensuring secure validation of claims.
- **Ethers.js**: Library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain and wallets.

## How It Works

### User Submission

1. Users submit data (e.g., attributes or credentials) through a secure frontend interface.
2. The data is encapsulated into a zkProof using zkPass.

### Proof Generation

- zkPass generates cryptographic proofs for submitted data using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Garbled Circuits.
- Proofs protect user data, revealing only the necessary details required for verification.

### Proof Verification

- The zkProof is verified on the frontend using the zkPass verification API.
- Verification ensures the authenticity of the user data without exposing the actual data.

### Result Handling

- Based on the proof verification result, appropriate actions are taken (e.g., granting access, confirming identity).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Dannynsikak/zkpass-Bounty.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd vite-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Set environment variables for the smart contract in a `.env` file.

5. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for additional zkProof protocols (e.g., zkSNARK, zkSTARK).
- Extend proof verification to server-side for hybrid workflows.
- Integrate with decentralized identity systems (e.g., DID).
